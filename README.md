# OpenVK Mobile (theme)
Mobile theme for OpenVK

The presented source code is at an early stage and may contain pieces of old OVK code. When the code is almost ready then we will include it in the official OpenVK repository.

### Including to OpenVK
In the `themepacks` folder (in the root folder of OVK), run this command: `git clone https://github.com/openvk/mobvk`
